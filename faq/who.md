## For whom
{{site.data.naming.servicename}} is primarily aimed at researchers who wish to make their research software available to a larger group of people.

## Access

Although the primary users of the service are researchers, access to the 
repositories hosted on {{site.data.naming.servicename}} can be much broader. The server is
accessible from anywhere on the internet, and the owner of a repository decides who can access her repository.

The owner of a repository[^1] can administer the project members. When the user that needs to be granted access has a netid, the owner can simply invite this user through his netid (Use the "Project information" -> "Members" menu option).

When the person that needs to be added to the project does not have an (active) netid, please do this @@@TODO@@@
