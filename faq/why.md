title: Why would you use this service?
parent: FAQ
---
{{site.data.naming.servicename}} is powered by the repository management software of [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com). Gitlab is also available as a public (free) service at gitlab.com. Also, there is the well-known service github.com that provides similar services.

So why would a researcher use {{site.data.naming.servicename}} and not one of these free services?

First of all: TU Delft thoroughly supports the FAIR principles, so if your project can use a public service that makes the data/program FAIR, there is no reason at all NOT to use these services. This is at the discretion of the researcher herself!

Having said that, we encounter a number of reasons why people do prefer using {{site.data.naming.servicename}}:


- **Use of netid**

    Researchers can use their netid to access the repository and grant access to others, making it easier to determine that the 'right' people have access.
- **TU Delft branding**

    Having your repository on a url that clearly names TU Delft can help your software's reputation.
- **Repository durability**

    We promise to keep your repository available for {{site.data.naming.defaultrepottl}}. Many public providers in practice do this as well, however they do not issue any guarantees. We recognize the importance of your published software and therefore do give this guarantee. See also our @@@TODO@@@: policy
- **(Dis)trust**

    Some researchers are uncomfortable using cloud services provided and managed by 'big tech'. {{site.data.naming.servicename}} is managed by TU Delft staff members. We strive to keep the data in control of TU Delft and secure.
