## Repository retainment
{{site.data.naming.servicename}} is primarily meant for researchers storing program code. That means we are optimized for repositories that do not grow above a few hundreds of megabytes. To allow maximum freedom for researchers however, we do not enforce a limit, trusting our researchers to make responsible use of the service.

We encourage the use of [git-sizer](https://github.com/github/git-sizer/#getting-started) for you to keep an eye on the size of your repo.[^1]
