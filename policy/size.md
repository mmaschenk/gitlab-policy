## Repository sizes and consequences of the size
{{site.data.naming.servicename}} is primarily meant for researchers storing program code. We strive to allow researchers maximum freedom in using the service. We do need to take into account the fact that storage costs resources (TU Delft invests money in storage systems, and running these storage systems impacts our ecological footprint). 

The following rules apply:

##### Repositories under {{site.data.naming.defaultreposizelimit}}

Your repository is in fine shape and does not warrant special attention from us. All default policies for retainment apply to it.

##### Repositories over {{site.data.naming.defaultreposizelimit}} but under {{site.data.naming.largereposizelimit}}

Your repository is quite large and is unlikely to consist of only source code (respect for your typing speed if it does). You will receive a monthly mail from us informing you of the issue together with suggestions on how to remedy the situation. The retainment policy for your repository will be *very large*, which means that the retainment time of the repository it is orphaned is shorter than usual (see [/policy/retainment)](/policy/retainment)).

##### Repositories over {{site.data.naming.largereposizelimit}}

Your repository is very large indeed. We will contact you to discuss your use-case and see if alternatives are available. In case we fail to receive a response, we will remove the repository within one month[^1]. The retainment policy for your repository will be *extremely large*. That means the retainment time is much shorter than the default (see [/policy/retainment)](/policy/retainment)).

[^1]: This rule will not be enforced if your repository was over the limit before the enforcement date of this policy ({{site.data.naming.policydate}}). In that case we will not single-sidedly remove your repository. We will try to contact you though, and the *extremely large* retainment policy will be applied.
